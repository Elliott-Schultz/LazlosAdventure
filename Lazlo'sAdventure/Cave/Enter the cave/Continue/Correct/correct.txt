You write down a single letter and the text begins to glow. You don't hear anything happening, but when you turn around, the cave is back. You are about to leave the room, when suddenly, you realize something. You look down at the quill you just used and after close examination, you realize it is one of the fletchings for the Typhoon Arrow. You gather up the other quills and store them away.
