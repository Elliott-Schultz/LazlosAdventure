You walk over to one of the holes in the wall and look inside. You can't see much, so you decide to reach inside to see what you find. You feel around for a while and then your hand touches something cold, metallic. You grab ahold of it and pull it out of the hole. You hold it under the torchlight to get a better look at it and in your hand was the broad head of the Typhoon Arrow. You put it in you bag and continue on your journey.
