You walk over to the stariwell and begin your climb upwards. It is a long climb, so you have to stop and take breaks every now and then, but eventually you make it to the top of the stariwell. At the top, there is a large set of doors, with gold handles. You open one of the doors very slowly in order to not alert the dragon of your presence. You look around the atrium and it is surprisingly well kept. There is no dust to be seen and everything is neat and organized. Next to the doorway, there is a large workbench, presumably used by the dwarves to create weaponry and armor. You walk over to it, so that you can try and reforge the decimator.
