You reach into the whole as far as you can. It is a tight fit for your arm, but you are able to extend your arm far enough for you to feel a small pouch at the bottom of the hole. You grab onto the pouch and pull it out of the hole.

You then open the bag to see if your troubles were worth it and they were.

Inside the pouch was the Pure String of the Elves.

You are extremely happy that you did not decide to leave the fortress before finding this.
