You walk up to the mirror while watching your reflection. You take a close look at the mirror and there seems to be an outline in the shape of a hand. You put your hand up to the mirror and align it with the outline. The outline begins to glow and the glass of the mirror suddenly turns to liquid, falling to the floor and collecting in a drain in the wall, which looked similar to a mouse hole. Behind where the glass used to be there is an opening with a keyhole.
