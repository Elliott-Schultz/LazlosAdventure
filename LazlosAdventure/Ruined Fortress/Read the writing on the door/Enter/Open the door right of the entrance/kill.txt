You push the button and nothing happens for a second. Suddenly, the door slams closed behind you and the walls on either side of you start to close in. You try and find a way to escape or brace the walls, but the door is locked and the table will not budge. The walls are now on either side of, pressing against your body. You feel your shoulders get pushed in and your collar bone snaps. The walls keep closing in, crushing your hips. You feel your rib cage start to break and your eyes pop out of your sockets, still being able to see the horror around you. The walls continue to press towards each other and you feel a broken rib puncture your lungs. You can feel the warm blood filling your lungs as you gasp for air, but you are too late. You begin to drown in your own blood as the walls keep closing in. Luckily for you, another broken rib punctures your heart, ending your suffering.
